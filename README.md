# SQL-the-sequel

## Description


My motivation for this project was to learn SQL to the best of my ability. As I've been scrolling through Linkedin and job offers I noticed that a lot of them are looking for SQL knowledge for their business so I thought it would be a great project to put work in to and try to absorb as much as I could.
SQL seems very handy for data sorting and management which I am interested in persuing as part of my career, I've seen higher end jobs in banks and big companies that want Data analyst skills and data sorting abilities. 
This project will help be a great reference for any future Data i may need to help organize for any future projects or work I have.
